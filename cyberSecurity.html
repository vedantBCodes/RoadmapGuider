                <h3> What is cybersecurity ?</h3><br>
                <p>

                    Cybersecurity is a subset of information technology associated with safeguarding computer systems
                    and information. Why is cybersecurity important? There are many types of cybersecurity threats,
                    including theft, hacking, viruses, and more. The computer security field has grown as more devices
                    become internet-enabled and more services are moved online. <br> <br>

                    Cyberattacks may result in stolen credit card information, personal details, and other sensitive
                    data. Security breaches typically occur when organizations’ and companies’ data centers are
                    compromised. They can impact banks, retail stores, online websites, and anywhere else consumers use
                    their digital information. Hackers also use fraudulent emails and social media to access sensitive
                    data from end-users. IT and cybersecurity experts are responsible for assessing security risks in
                    order to better protect customers. <br>
                </p>
            </div>
        </a>

        <a name="Q2">
            <div>
                <h3>Why Is Cybersecurity Important ?</h3> <br>
                <p>

                    Data breaches expose sensitive information to people with malicious intent – think things like
                    passwords, credit card information, phone numbers, protected health information, personally
                    identifiable information, and sensitive documents (such as copyrights, trade secrets, patents, and
                    so on). <br> <br>

                    But, information theft is often not the only goal of a cyberattack — hackers and bad actors also
                    attack infrastructure controls and compromise data integrity. With the power of AI tools, these
                    cyber threats are only projected to increase in both frequency and complexity. <br> <br>

                    Therefore, it’s critical – both at the individual and organizational level – to secure the data that
                    so many rely on. <br>

            <a name="Q3">
            <div>
                <h3>Basic Education Requirements for Cybersecurity Jobs</h3><br>
                <p>

                    This is likely the first thing you googled – “Do you need a bachelor’s degree to get a Cybersecurity
                    job?”<br>

                    Cybersecurity is a vast field with a variety of different roles available. No matter your
                    background, there is something you can contribute to the cybersecurity discussion. Due to this,
                    there are no true “basic education requirements” that would apply across the board for every single
                    cybersecurity position. In fact, many entry-level cybersecurity jobs do not require a bachelor’s
                    degree in cybersecurity or related fields. For more senior roles, it may be required to hold a
                    degree or specific certification. <br> <br>

                    But, this is about entry-level – so let’s move on to how your transferable skills can apply to
                    cybersecurity (no degree required). <br>

                <h3>Find a Specialty</h3>

                Over the years, cybersecurity has matured into a diverse field with different specialties. In an
                enterprise, a cybersecurity expert is promoted to superior positions based on the cybersecurity
                specialization they have. <br> <br>

                You can choose the specialty you want to build a career in based on your interest. If you’re interested
                in the field, it’ll be easier for you to master the art and keep yourself abreast of all recent
                developments in this field. Apart from finding your interest, you should also focus on learning about
                the different areas where cybersecurity experts are needed. Some common specialties are: <br>

                <b>Application security:</b> It involves ensuring that applications and programs perform as expected and
                do not
                contain vulnerabilities. Application security professionals typically focus on the software development
                life cycle (SDLC) and encourage developers to write secure code. They also reinforce secure coding
                practices throughout the organization. <br>
                <b>Network security:</b> These professionals work with firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other
                network security appliances. They ensure that the organization’s networks remain secure, even as new
                vulnerabilities are discovered. They also maintain firewall rules and configure routers/switches to
                allow only authorized traffic to access networks. <br>
                <b>Penetration testing:</b> Hacking can be a good thing, too! Penetration testers use several techniques
                to
                identify security vulnerabilities in websites, systems, and applications before criminals do. They then
                report their findings from the pen test to the appropriate parties. Penetration testers work closely
                with developers, auditors, and management to ensure that vulnerabilities are fixed quickly. <br>
                </p>

                <h3>Get a Certification</h3>
                Cybersecurity professionals, like cybersecurity analysts, can also benefit from certifications, such as
                CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA CSA+, and the Cisco CCNA. <br> <br>

                As 59% of employers require applicants to have cybersecurity certifications, a combination of
                certifications and a bootcamp works well for most people. <br> <br>

                The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification from ISC is one of the
                most sought-out credentials in the cybersecurity industry. You should get this certification if you want
                to learn specific skills for certain jobs, such as information assurance analyst, IT security engineer,
                and security administrator. If you want to specialize in IT project management or security engineering,
                you should get the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) certification from ISACA. <br>

            <h3>2. Evaluate your passion for technology.</h3> <br>

            There’s a difference between difficult and challenging. Learning cybersecurity can be challenging, but it
            doesn’t have to be difficult, especially if you’re passionate about technology. Nurture a curiosity for the
            technologies you’re working with, and you might find that challenging skills become easier. <br> <br>

            Sometimes just the act of learning is enough to build enthusiasm about a topic. If you’re someone who
            thrives off the enthusiasm of others, getting involved in a community of other security professionals (Tip
            7) could also help. <br> <br>

            Maybe after taking a course or two, you’ll discover that your passions lie elsewhere. That’s okay too.
            Cybersecurity can be an exciting, challenging, and well-paying profession, but it’s not for everyone. <br>

            <h3> 3. Learn a little every day. </h3><br>


            Building cybersecurity skills doesn’t have to mean dropping everything for a degree or full-time bootcamp. A
            little time each day can lead to big results. Start by setting aside 15 minutes each day to focus on
            cybersecurity. Plan out your learning time, and try to make it the same time every day. <br> <br>

            Besides setting aside a consistent time to learn, it’s also a good idea to plan what you want to accomplish
            in each session. Be specific (for example “watch two lecture videos,” “take Lesson 3 quiz,” or “read Chapter
            Four”). <br> <br>

            <h3>4. Become an ethical hacker.</h3><br>


            One of the best ways to learn is by doing. In cybersecurity, one way to get firsthand experience using the
            tools and techniques of the trade is to practice ethical hacking. <br> <br>

            <div id="ethicalHacking">
                <b>What is ethical hacking ?</b> <br>
                The EC-Council, provider of the popular Certified Ethical Hacker certification, defines ethical hacking
                as
                “the process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure
                that
                an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization.” <br> <br>

                In other works, ethical hacking is a legal, authorized to break into a computer system, network,
                application, or database. <br> </div> <br>

                Several free websites allow you to develop your cybersecurity skill set through legal, gamified
                experiences. Try these to get started: <br> <br>

            <br>

            <h3> 5. Practice in simulated environments.</h3><br>


            Many cybersecurity courses include virtual labs where you can practice applying your skills using real
            security tools in simulated environments. It’s convenient to have these labs ready to go as part of a
            structured course, but you can get as much practice as you want by setting up your own virtual lab. A basic
            lab environment will typically include three elements: <br> <br>

            1. A <b>cloud environment</b> to host virtual machines <br>

            2. A <b>target machine</b> to launch attacks on <br>

            3. An <b>attack box</b>, or machine you will use to plan and perform attacks <br> <br>

            <h3>6. Mix it up with workplace skills.</h3><br>


            If you need a break from technical skill-building, spend some time working on your workplace skills. <br>
            <br>

            As a cybersecurity expert, you'll often need to communicate complex concepts to people who might not have a
            technical background. You may also work cross-functionally with other teams, like legal or public relations.
            Many cybersecurity roles involve making key decisions on the spot. This means hiring managers look for
            candidates with critical thinking skills. <br> <br>

            <h3> 7. Earn a certification.</h3><br>


            Preparing for a cybersecurity certification exam can double as an effective way to develop your skill set.
            Plus, having a certification can enhance your resume and make you more competitive as a job candidate. HR
            Dive reports that 67 percent of IT employers request industry certifications [1]. <br> <br>

            These are the 10 cybersecurity certifications that showed up most frequently in job listings (as of June
            2023). <br>

                    <summary>Is cybersecurity a lot of math ?</summary> <br>
                    Cybersecurity is generally not considered a particularly math-heavy career. Some cybersecurity
                    degree programs may have some higher-level math requirements, but on the job, you’ll likely need a
                    basic understanding of binary math and mathematical logic. Exceptions include roles involving
                    cryptography, which may require more advanced mathematical ability. <br>

                    <summary>Is cybersecurity a good career ?</summary> <br>

                    Cybersecurity as a field typically has more open jobs than there are qualified candidates to fill
                    them. There are over half a million cybersecurity job openings in the US at the time of writing,
                    according to Cyber Seek [2]. These jobs also tend to be well-paid. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics
                    reports a median salary of $112,000 for information security analysts in the US [3]. <br>

                    <summary>Is a cybersecurity degree hard ?</summary> <br>

                    Cybersecurity degree programs tend to have fewer higher-level math and science requirements than
                    computer science and other STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) degrees. This means that
                    you might not have to take classes like calculus and chemistry, often considered among the most
                    challenging for college students. While some courses require labs, these are generally not
                    research-based. <br> <br>

                    On the other hand, you can expect courses to get increasingly challenging as you move through a
                    cybersecurity program. The material can also be quite technical and challenging to read. <br>

                    You might not be required to code as part of your day-to-day requirements as a data analyst.
                    However,
                    knowing how to write some basic Python or R, as well as how to write queries in SQL (Structured
                    Query
                    Language) can help you clean, analyze, and visualize data.<br>
