                <h3>What Is Cloud Computing ?</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage,
                    servers, databases, networking, and software over the internet. The data is stored on physical
                    servers, which are maintained by a cloud service provider. Computer system resources, especially
                    data storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in
                    cloud computing. <br> <br>
                    Cloud computing plays a pivotal role in our everyday lives, whether accessing a cloud application
                    like Google Gmail, streaming a movie on Netflix or playing a cloud-hosted video game. <br> <br>

                    Cloud computing has also become indispensable in business settings, from small startups to global
                    enterprises. Its many business applications include enabling remote work by making data and
                    applications accessible from anywhere, creating the framework for seamless omnichannel customer
                    engagement and providing the vast computing power and other resources needed to take advantage of
                    cutting-edge technologies like generative AI and quantum computing. <br> <br>

                    A cloud services provider (CSP) manages cloud-based technology services hosted at a remote data
                    center and typically makes these resources available for a pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription
                    fee. <br>

                <h3>Architecture of cloud computing</h3>
                <img src="Images/Cloud_Computing_images/cloudArchitecutre2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"> <br>
                <p>
                    Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it
                    possible to access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. The services
                    hosted on cloud can be broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS),
                    platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). Based on the deployment model, cloud
                    can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud. <br> <br>
                    Further, cloud can be divided into two different layers, namely, front-end and back-end. The layer
                    with which users interact is called the
                    front-end layer. This layer enables a user to access the data that has been stored in cloud through
                    cloud computing software. <br> <br>
                    The layer made up of software and hardware, i.e., the computers, servers,
                    central servers, and databases, is the back-end layer. This layer is the primary component of cloud
                    and is entirely responsible for storing information securely. To ensure seamless connectivity
                    between devices linked via cloud computing, the central servers use a software called
                    middlewareOpens a new window that acts as a bridge between the database and applications. <br>

                <h3>Types of Cloud Computing</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing can either be classified based on the deployment model or the type of service. Based
                    on the specific deployment model, we can classify cloud as public, private, and hybrid cloud. At the
                    same time, it can be classified as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS),
                    and software-as-a-service (SaaS) based on the service the cloud model offers.

                    <b>Private Cloud</b> <br>
                    In a private cloud, the computing services are offered over a private IT network for the dedicated
                    use of a single organization. Also termed internal, enterprise, or corporate cloud, a private cloud
                    is usually managed via internal resources and is not accessible to anyone outside the organization.
                    Private cloud computing provides all the benefits of a public cloud, such as self-service,
                    scalability, and elasticity, along with additional control, security, and customization. <br> <br>


                    <b>Public Cloud</b> <br>
                    Public cloud refers to computing services offered by third-party providers over the internet. Unlike
                    private cloud, the services on public cloud are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase
                    them. These services could be free or sold on-demand, where users only have to pay per usage for the
                    CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.<br> <br>

                    <b>Hybrid Cloud</b> <br>
                    Hybrid cloud uses a combination of public and private cloud features. The “best of both worlds”
                    cloud model allows a shift of workloads between private and public clouds as the computing and cost
                    requirements change. When the demand for computing and processing fluctuates, hybrid cloudOpens a
                    new window allows businesses to scale their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to
                    handle the overflow while ensuring that no third-party data centers have access to their data. <br>

                <h3>Benefits of cloud computing</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    Compared to traditional on-premises IT that involves a company owning and maintaining physical data
                    centers and servers to access computing power, data storage and other resources (and depending on
                    the cloud services you select), cloud computing offers many benefits, including the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Cost-effectiveness</b> <br>

                    Cloud computing lets you offload some or all of the expense and effort of purchasing,
                    installing, configuring and managing mainframe computers and other on-premises
                    infrastructure. You pay only for cloud-based infrastructure and other computing resources as
                    you use them. <br> <br>

                    <b>Increased speed and agility</b> <br>

                    With cloud computing, your organization can use enterprise applications in minutes instead
                    of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond to a request, purchase and configure supporting
                    hardware and install software. This feature empowers users—specifically DevOps and other
                    development teams—to help leverage cloud-based software and support infrastructure. <br>
                    <br>

                    <b> Enhanced strategic value</b> <br>

                    Cloud computing enables organizations to use various technologies and the most up-to-date
                    innovations to gain a competitive edge. For instance, in retail, banking and other
                    customer-facing industries, generative AI-powered virtual assistants deployed over the cloud
                    can deliver better customer response time and free up teams to focus on higher-level work.

                    The origins of cloud computing technology go back to the early 1960s when Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett
                    Licklider (link resides outside ibm.com), an American computer scientist and psychologist known as
                    the "father of cloud computing", introduced the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of
                    memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s that
                    modern cloud infrastructure for business emerged. <br> <br>

                    In 2002, Amazon Web Services started cloud-based storage and computing services. In 2006, it
                    introduced Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), an offering that allowed users to rent virtual computers to
                    run their applications. That same year, Google introduced the Google Apps suite (now called Google
                    Workspace), a collection of SaaS productivity applications. In 2009, Microsoft started its first
                    SaaS application, Microsoft Office 2011. Today, Gartner predicts worldwide end-user spending on the
                    public cloud will total USD 679 billion and is projected to exceed USD 1 trillion in 2027 (link

                <summary>What is cloud ?</summary> <br>
                The cloud is an extensive network of remote servers around the world. These servers store and manage
                data, run applications, and deliver content and services like streaming videos, web mail, and office
                productivity software over the internet. Storing your files and data in the cloud frees you from
                relying on local computers and servers. Instead, you can access your data online from any
                internet-capable device, whenever and wherever you want. <br>

                <summary>What is Multicloud computing ?</summary> <br>
                Multicloud computing entails using multiple cloud computing services from more than one cloud
                provider for the same type of IT solutions or workloads. A multicloud strategy—which may include
                both private and public clouds—helps organizations mitigate risk and offers them increased workload
                flexibility. Choosing different offerings and capabilities from more than one cloud provider enables
                organizations to build solutions that are best suited to their specific IT needs. <br>

                <summary>What skills are required for cloud computing ?</summary> <br>
                In general, cloud computing does not require technical IT experience. Cloud computing simply refers
                to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, databases, software, and
                analytics. Whether you have a basic understanding of computing concepts and terminology or are a
                more technical worker, you can apply the on-premises computing knowledge and skills you currently
                have to the cloud. <br>

                <summary>How much does cloud computing cost ?</summary> <br>
                Cloud providers typically employ a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means that organizations only
                pay for the cloud services that they use. This helps companies reduce their operating costs, run
                their infrastructure more efficiently, and scale their cloud computing costs up or down according to
                changing business needs. For example, Azure offers pay-as-you-go pricing with no upfront commitment
                and free services that include popular services free for 12 months and 55+ other services free
                always.<br>
