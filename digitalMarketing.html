            <h3>What is digital marketing ?</h3> <br>
            <p>

                Digital marketing is the use of digital channels to market products. Also known as online marketing,
                digital marketing promotes brands and connects them to potential customers via the internet. It takes
                many forms, including: <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Search engines</li>
                <li>Websites</li>
                <li>Social media</li>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>Mobile apps</li>
                <li>Text messaging</li>
                <li>Web-based advertising</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Digital marketing uses the same principles as traditional offline marketing but in a digital space. It
                relies on consumer data to find a business's target audience and deliver the most relevant messaging
                possible. This is effective, but digital marketing is so popular that the biggest challenge today is
                learning how to stand out from the crowd.</p>
            </p>

            <h3> Which Skills Do You Need for Digital Marketing Success?</h3> <br>
            <p>
                There are many different facets to digital marketing, and providing yourself with a general education in
                all of these different areas — from Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and social media to email marketing
                — is essential if you are to understand how different disciplines work together to drive success. <br>
                <br>

                When recruiting digital marketing professionals to join your team, you should look for those who possess
                this general grounding and also excel in one to two specialist areas. Rand Fishkin, of leading search
                engine marketing site Moz, calls an individual with this basic understanding of multiple digital
                marketing disciplines and specialism in one or two areas a “T-Shaped Web Marketer”, and says that
                candidates like this are valuable assets to companies because they understand how different disciplines
                fit together and can step in to support in different areas where necessary. <br> <br>

                So start thinking like a T-Shape if you want to be able to spot and recruit the best for your business
                going forward! <br> <br>

            <h3>Is It Worth Paying for a Digital Marketing Course ?</h3> <br>
            <p>

                If the success of your business hinges on effective online marketing campaigns, like most modern
                companies, then it is well worth paying a one-time fee for a digital marketing certification that
                signals your expertise to potential investors and business partners. <br> <br>

                The Hootsuite <a href="https://education.hootsuite.com/courses/social-marketing-certification">Social
                    Media Marketing Certification</a> provided by Hootsuite Academy costs $199 USD and
                provides you with an industry-recognised certification that demonstrates your expertise in social
                marketing to potential clients and investors. For the course fee, you also get a listing in the
                Hootsuite Certified Professionals Directory and a permanent online certificate you can link to from your
                blog, website or other online profile. <br> <br>

                <a href="https://contentmarketinguniversity.com/">A Content Marketing Institute (CMI)</a> online
                certification is the perfect way to demonstrate your
                copywriting skills. The course costs a little under a thousand dollars but covers a wide spectrum of
                content marketing topics, such as planning, audience, story, channels, process, conversation and
                measurement. The programme can be worked through at your own pace and you can take the courses on offer
                in any order. <br>

            <h3>How to Learn Digital Marketing at Home for Free ?</h3> <br>
            <p>
                <b> A Step-By-Step Guide </b> <br> <br>
                The good news is that learning the skills you need for digital marketing is often possible at home, in
                your spare time, thanks to the wealth of free online resources available. We discuss our favourite
                resources below and give our advice on how to get started. <br> <br>

                <b>Here are our six steps to digital marketing success:</b> <br>

            <h5>Step 1 - Study</h5> <br>
            Acquire the necessary knowledge to become a successful digital marketer by reading free guides online —
            everything from blog posts to eBooks and course materials created by experienced marketers, marketing
            agencies and universities. <br> <br>

            <h5>Step 2 - Practice, Practice, Practice</h5> <br>
            The best form of education is actively putting into practice what you’ve learned. Create test campaigns,
            monitor the results, optimise the campaigns and learn from your mistakes. You’ll be following the
            instructions provided by the study materials you’re using and there’s no risk involved as you aren’t yet
            dealing with digital advertising budgets for real businesses. <br> <br>

            <h5>Step 3 - Get Certified and Qualified</h5> <br>
            Now that you're confident with the study materials, take the associated certifications and
            qualifications to test your knowledge. <br> <br>

            <h5>Step 4 - Start Your Own Digital Marketing Blog</h5> <br>
            Having your own digital marketing blog will help you practice what you’ve learned and demonstrate your
            expertise. It will also help you start to make connections in the industry as you seek out guest
            writers, invite opinions on your posts and offer to write for other publications. <br> <br>

            <h5>Step 5 - Seek Out Training and Support from Experienced Digital Marketers</h5> <br>
            Put those new contacts you’ve made to good use. To progress as a digital marketer, you will need support
            and guidance from experienced professionals who can point you in the right direction. <br> <br>

            <h5>Step 6 - Keep Learning and Improving</h5> <br>
            Digital marketing is an ever-changing and evolving field that requires its practitioners to be
            constantly evolving too. Never stop seeking out new learning materials and opportunities to improve your
            skills. <br>
