                    <h3> What is SQL ?</h3> 
                    <p>

                        SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is the standard language for communicating with
                        relational
                        databases.

                        It's a relatively simple language as far as coding goes, but it's also incredibly powerful. <br>
                        <br>
                        <center><img src="Images/SQL_Images/secondSubpageBgImage.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid " style="border-radius: 10px;"></center> <br>

                        You can write SQL statements to retrieve specific data from large databases, update data on a
                        database,
                        and much more. Relational database management systems like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server,
                        Sybase,
                        and Ingres use SQL. <br>

                    <p>
                        
                        Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language that is frequently used in all types
                        of applications. Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it integrates well with
                        different programming languages. For example, they can embed SQL queries with the Java
                        programming language to build high-performing data processing applications with major SQL
                        database systems such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. SQL is also fairly easy to learn as it uses
                        common English keywords in its statements
                    </p>

                    <h3> Why should you learn SQL ?</h3> <br>
                    <p>
                        In our data-hungry world, the ability to successfully work with data is becoming more and more
                        valuable. It's an in-demand skill and not just for data analysts. Financial teams, programmers,
                        and
                        even non-technical people in marketing, sales, and other functions can all benefit from
                        understanding what it takes to extract the data they need from a large database. <br> <br>

                        You don't necessarily need to become a SQL all-star, but understanding the basics will teach you
                        how
                        to ask better data-related questions (at the very least). <br>

                    <h3>What are SQL commands ?</h3>
                    <p>

                        Structured query language (SQL) commands are specific keywords or SQL statements that developers
                        use
                        to manipulate the data stored in a relational database. You can categorize SQL commands as
                        follows.
                        <br>

                        <b>Data definition language</b>
                        Data definition language (DDL) refers to SQL commands that design the database structure.
                        Database
                        engineers use DDL to create and modify database objects based on the business requirements. For
                        example, the database engineer uses the CREATE command to create database objects such as
                        tables,
                        views, and indexes.<br> <br>

                        <b>Data query language</b>
                        Data query language (DQL) consists of instructions for retrieving data stored in relational
                        databases. Software applications use the SELECT command to filter and return specific results
                        from a
                        SQL table.<br> <br>

                        <b>Data manipulation language</b>
                        Data manipulation language (DML) statements write new information or modify existing records in
                        a
                        relational database. For example, an application uses the INSERT command to store a new record
                        in
                        the database.<br> <br>

                        <b>Data control language</b>
                        Database administrators use data control language (DCL) to manage or authorize database access
                        for
                        other users. For example, they can use the GRANT command to permit certain applications to
                        manipulate one or more tables.<br> <br>

                        <b>Transaction control language</b>
                        The relational engine uses transaction control language (TCL) to automatically make database
                        changes. For example, the database uses the ROLLBACK command to undo an erroneous transaction.

            <p class="display-6">How to Learn SQL (3 Methods)</p> <br>
            <p>There are plenty of online resources that you can use to learn SQL. Let’s look at some effective ways to
                master this language.</p>

            <h3>1. Find a YouTube Tutorial</h3>
            <p>

                If you’re looking to learn SQL as fast as possible, YouTube is a great place to start. Rather than
                completing a lengthy course, you can find a tutorial that simplifies the language into its core
                concepts.
                <br> <br>

                For example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0nxCDiD-zg">SQL for Beginners Tutorial
                </a>will
                teach you how to retrieve data from a database: <br>
                <img src="Images/SQL_Images/howToLearnImage1.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid"> <br>

                Learn SQL for beginners course on YouTube
                In this 45-minute video, you’ll learn the basics of SQL, databases, and Relational Database Management
                Systems. The creator will walk you through installing Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Management
                Studio.
                Using these free tools, you can familiarize yourself with tables, primary keys, data types, and more.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Take a Free Course</h3> <br>
            <p>
                Some people prefer structured courses. Fortunately, there are many e-learning materials that focus on
                the
                fundamentals. By completing untimed modules, you can become an SQL developer at your own pace. <br>

                One of the best platforms to learn coding skills is Codecademy. After you create an account, you can
                look
                for beginner courses such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql">Learn SQL.</a> This
                course
                will teach you how to use SQL to communicate with
                relational databases: <br>
                <img src="Images/SQL_Images/howToLearnImage2.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                In each module, you’ll be able to enter commands, run queries, and use functions to perform database
                operations:
            </p>

            <h3>3. Earn a Certification</h3> <br>
            <p>
                In most cases, you won't need a college degree to work with SQL. However, you might want to showcase
                your
                coding skills on your resume. When looking for a position that requires knowledge of SQL, having a
                certification can increase your chances of getting hired. <br> <br>

                Fortunately, you can easily gain a SQL certification online. Coursera’s <a
                    href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-sql">Introduction to Structured Query
                    Language </a>teaches you how to create a MySQL database. Once you complete the course, you’ll
                receive a
                certificate: <br> <br>

                Keep in mind that this is the second level in the Web Applications for Everybody Specialization. To get
                up
                to speed, you’ll have to first take the Building Web Applications in PHP course. If you’re already
                familiar
                with PHP, HTML, and CSS, feel free to sign up for the SQL lessons.
