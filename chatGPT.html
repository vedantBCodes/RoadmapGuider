              ChatGPT is a natural language processing chatbot driven by
              generative AI that allows you to have human-like conversations to
              complete various tasks. For example, the AI tool can answer
              questions and assist you with tasks such as composing emails,
              essays, and code.

              A paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus launched at the
              beginning of February 2023 which gives users access to premium
              features, such as OpenAI's latest models.

            <br />
            <p>
              ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an AI research company. The company
              launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. OpenAI is also responsible
              for DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3, popular AI image generators, and
              Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.

            <h2>Who owns ChatGPT currently ?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              OpenAI owns ChatGPT. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI with
              a multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment. Elon Musk was an
              investor when OpenAI was first founded in 2015. However, he has
              since completely severed ties with the company and created his own
              AI chatbot, Grok.

            <h2>What is ChatGPT used for ?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              ChatGPT has many functions in addition to answering simple
              questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, have philosophical
              conversations, do math, and even code for you. <br />
              <br />

              The tasks ChatGPT can help with also don't have to be so
              ambitious. For example, my favorite use of ChatGPT is for help
              creating basic lists for chores, such as packing and grocery
              shopping, and to-do lists that make my daily life more productive.
              The possibilities are endless. <br />
              <br />

              ZDNET has published many ChatGPT how-to guides. Here are some of
              the most popular.

              ChatGPT is free to use, regardless of
              what you use it for, including writing, coding, and much more. There
              is a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-vs-chatgpt-plus-is-it-worth-the-subscription-fee/">subscription option</a>, ChatGPT Plus, that users can take advantage
              of that costs $20/month.  <br> <br>
              The paid subscription model guarantees users
              extra perks, such as general access even at capacity, access to GPT-4,
              faster response times, and internet browsing.

            <p>
              On April 1, OpenAI stopped requiring users to log in to use
              ChatGPT. Now, you can access ChatGPT simply by visiting
              <a href="https://chat.openai.com/"> chat.openai.com.</a> You can
              also access ChatGPT via an app on your iPhone or Android device.
              <br />
              <br />

              Once you visit the site, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT.
              A great way to get started is by asking a question, similar to
              what you would do with Google. You can ask as many questions as
              you'd like. <br />
              <br />

              There are still some perks to creating an OpenAI account, such as
              the ability to save and review chat history and access custom
              instructions. Creating an OpenAI account is entirely free and
              easy, with logging in with your Google account being an option.

       <img src="Images/ChatGPT_Page Images/step4Image.png" alt="" width="500vw"> <br>
       <p class="tip py-2 mx-5">EXTRA TIP -Note, that the more details and information you give the AI bot, the more specific the response will be. For example, if you wanted to write lyrics to a song in the style of a particular artist, you can tell ChatGPT that. What if you want the lyrics to rhyme? Natural language processing (NLP) can do that too, as long as you prompt it beforehand.</p>
