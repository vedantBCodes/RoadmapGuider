        <br />
        <p>
          Whether you want to learn video editing for a career change, as a
          hobby, or as a side career, there are a number of ways to learn video
          editing including courses, university programs, and online training.
          If you are seeking to enter the video editing industry, now is a good
          time as the video editing industry is projected to grow in the coming
          years. Here are several ways to begin learning video editing: <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Learn video editing with classes and workshops</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          One way to learn video editing is through classes and workshops.
          Intensive workshops can get you started with most common video editing
          applications over a number of days. <br />
          <br />

          The American Graphics Institute offers courses for the most commonly
          used editing software, including Premiere Pro courses along with Final
          Cut courses for learning video editing as well as After Effects
          courses for learning special effects. Courses for these applications
          are offered for both introductory and experienced editors, and prepare
          students for work in video, television, and broadcast fields. These
          video editing classes can be taken online or in person.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>University programs for learning video editing</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          For those interested in a long-term, holistic approach to learning
          video editing there are four-year undergraduate degrees available in
          film and cinema. These programs often combine study of theory and
          principles along with project-based learning, allowing students to
          graduate with experience and connections that help them apply for
          industry jobs or begin their own video editing business. <br />
          <br />

          Core classes offered for video editing degrees cover essential skills
          necessary to succeed. Other electives, such as audio editing,
          animation, and special effects, can be taken to learn skills that
          allow for specialization within a video editing career. In addition to
          establishing a solid foundation, professors and collaborators from
          previous projects can provide letters of recommendation for job
          applications or reviews for a business website.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Online tutorials for learning video editing</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you are looking to casually learn video editing, there are free
          online tutorials that can help you navigate the workspaces of video
          editing software, including how to customize an interface, manage
          media, and trim clips. Browse through American Graphic Institute
          Premiere Pro tutorials and After Effects tutorials for its digital
          visual effects counterpart application.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Independent options for learning video editing</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another way to learn video editing software is by gathering footage,
          uploading the clips, and playing around with sequencing and other
          effects. Video editing is a trade that requires hands-on learning;
          researching and watching tutorials only gets you so far. Still, it’s
          informative to research basic uses and shortcuts by going through the
          software’s user guide. <br />
          <br />

          Video editing skills can also be supplemented through blog posts,
          books, and tutorials on advanced techniques, such as color grading,
          sound effects, and media organization. Seeking out advice from experts
          within an industry is always useful. By employing experts’ advice,
          video editors can complete quality work quickly and begin to discover
          their own editing preferences and style.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Learn video editing advanced techniques to boost income</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Credibility and experience improve the likelihood of being chosen to
          edit a project. One way to become a skilled video editor is by
          actively seeking out job opportunities. Pitching video editing
          proposals to local businesses or placing work bids on freelance
          websites can help novice video editors build a diverse portfolio and
          demo reel. Another way to compete for project bids is by taking
          classes or getting a video editing certificate. By completing outside
          training, job applicants can establish credibility and demonstrate a
          commitment to mastering their craft. <br />
          <br />

          AGI offers part- and full-time video editing certificate programs,
          which can be taken online or in person. Certificate courses in both
          formats are led by live instructors who provide expertise to aspiring
          digital artists on applying effects and editing videos.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Learning video editing for starting a career</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is possible to establish yourself as a successful video editor
          without getting a formal degree. Taking individual courses or a short
          term certificate can provide the foundational skills needed without
          the cost of a four-year degree. Completed projects, which are overseen
          by industry experts during classes, can be used as part of portfolios
          or demo reels for future job applications. As you build upon these
          with additional work, your experience, skills gained, and professional
          connections will all grow. <br />

      <div class="Question">
        <details>
          <summary>What is video editing ?</summary> <br>
          <p>
            Video editing is the process of putting various video shots together
            and arranging them in a way that has a logical and artistic flow.
            When you edit a video, you play a key role in the postproduction
            process. As an editor, you'll have more footage than you'll need for
            the finished product, so you have to make sure you choose the best
            shots that will improve the final version of the project. Editing
            involves removing shots that aren't necessary or don't fit, making
            sure that the continuity between the shots that you use is correct,
            and ensuring the proper transition between scenes.

          <p>
            Once you've learned video editing, you can use those skills in a
            career in the entertainment industry or in the field of advertising.
            Film and television studios and advertising agencies need editors
            with the ability to create compelling videos, so knowing how to edit
            can give you a leg up in either industry. Local news stations also
            need video editors who can put together news reports, often with
            fast deadlines. You can edit videos for corporations, either as a
            freelance editor or on staff with a company's communications
            department. There are also opportunities for you to strike out on
            your own as a video editor for family events like weddings and
            birthday parties.
