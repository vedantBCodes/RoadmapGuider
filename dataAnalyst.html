                <h3>What is data analysis?</h3>
                <p>
                    Data analysis is the process of gleaning insights from data to inform better business decisions. The
                    process of analyzing data typically moves through five iterative phases: <br> <br>

                    1. <b>Identify</b> the data you want to analyze <br>

                    2. <b>Collect</b> the data <br>

                    3. <b>Clean</b> the data in preparation for analysis <br>

                    4. <b>Analyze</b> the data <br>

                    5. <b>Interpret</b> the results of the analysis <br> <br>

                    Data analysis can take different forms, depending on the question you’re trying to answer. You can
                    read more about the types of data analysis here. Briefly, descriptive analysis tells us what
                    happened, diagnostic analysis tells us why it happened, predictive analytics forms projections about
                    the future, and prescriptive analysis creates actionable advice on what actions to take.

            <div>
                <h3>Who is a Data Analyst ?</h3>
                <p>
                    A data analyst collects, processes, and performs analysis of large datasets. Every business, be it
                    small or big, generates, and collects data. This data can be in the form of customer feedback,
                    accounts, logistics, marketing research, and so on. <br> <br>

                    A data analyst is a professional who takes this data and figures out numerous measures, such as how
                    to improve customer experience, price new materials, and how to reduce transportation costs, to name
                    a few. Data Analysts deal with data handling, data modeling, and reporting. <br> <br>

                    Once you know who is a data analyst, it's paramount to know the roles and responsibilities of a data
                    analyst. <br>

                <h3>What Does a Data Analyst Do ?</h3>
                <p>
                    A data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a business’s customers and ways the data
                    can be used to solve problems. They also communicate this information to company leadership and
                    other stakeholders. <br>
                    <center><img src="Images/Data_Analysis_Images/dataAnalystImage.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid"
                            style="height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; "></center> <br> <br>
                    In today's technology-driven world, data is collected, analyzed and interpreted to solve a wide
                    range of business problems. With a career as a data analyst, you could play a decisive role in the
                    growth and success of an organization. <br>

                    A data analyst is a lot more than a number cruncher. Analysts review data and determine how to solve
                    problems using data, learn critical insights about a business's customers and boost profits.
                    Analysts also communicate this information with key stakeholders, including company leadership. <br>
                    <br>

                    Data analysts play a vital role in a modern company, helping to reflect on its work and customer
                    base, determining how these factors have affected profits and advising leadership on ways to move
                    forward to grow the business. <br> <br>

                    According to McKenzie, successful data analysts have strong mathematical and statistical skills, as
                    well as: <br>

                    1. <b>Analytical skills</b> to gather, view and analyze information <br>
                    2. <b>Numerical skills</b> to measure and statistically analyze data <br>
                    3. <b>Technical skills</b> including software and scripting languages to organize and present data
                    <br>

                <p>
                    What Does a Data Analyst Do? Gaining experience as a data analyst may also lead to opportunities in
                    related fields. Numerous entrant-level data analysts progress to more senior positions as data
                    scientists. Data scientists, like analysts, conduct their work using quantitative and computational
                    methods. On the other hand, a scientist might employ cutting-edge techniques to construct models and
                    other instruments to shed light on upcoming tendencies. <br>

                    We know that career-change can be a daunting prospect, so we’ve broken it down as simply as
                    possible. In just five steps, you can go from aspiring data analyst to fully-fledged professional.
                    For now, here’s your step-by-step plan of action! <br> <br>

                    <a name="step1">
                <h3> Step 1: Get familiar with the fundamentals</h3>

                This first step is all about immersing yourself in the world of data analytics and getting familiar with
                some of the key tools and principles. There are two components to this step: <br> <br>

                1. Embracing the theory behind data analytics <br>
                2. Getting hands-on with some key data analytics tools <br> <br>
                Before you do anything else, absorb as much theory as you can about data analytics. Read about how data
                analytics is being used in the real world, and familiarize yourself with the kinds of analyses that a
                data analyst might perform. As a focal point for your reading, we recommend researching the different
                types of data analysis and getting to grips with the various data analytics techniques, such as: <br>

                &#149; regression analysis <br>
                &#149; factor analysis <br>
                &#149; cohort analysis <br>
                &#149; cluster analysis <br>
                &#149; time-series analysis <br> <br>
            </a>

                <a name="step2">
                <h3> Step 2: Commit to the process with a structured course</h3> <br>

                Now it’s time to get serious about your career-change. While the internet is full of wonderful and free
                resources, it won’t give you the structured approach or the hands-on practice that you need. If you want
                to become an employable data analyst, the most effective (and rewarding) way to do so is through a
                specialized program or course. <br> <br>

                However, not all data analytics courses are created equal, so this step requires extensive research.
                When choosing a program, it’s crucial to find a structure that complements your schedule (especially if
                you plan on working and studying at the same time) and fits your budget. Most importantly, however, we
                strongly recommend investing in a course that can offer the following: <br> <br>

                &#149; <b>Mentorship:</b> The best courses on the market offer one-to-one mentorship, which is crucial
                for staying
                motivated and getting genuine feedback on your work. <br><br>
                &#149; <b>A practical, hands-on curriculum:</b> Many courses will teach you the theory with the help of
                curated
                resources, but what’s really important is that you master and apply the necessary practical skills as
                you go. Look for a course that will test your knowledge continuously with practical exercises, as well
                as focusing on project work and helping you build your portfolio. <br> <br>
                &#149; <b>Career coaching and a job guarantee:</b> If your primary goal is to get hired as a data
                analyst, it’s
                important that you have access to expert career advice. Some of the top-tier courses on the market offer
                career coaching and a job guarantee, ensuring you find the right role once you’ve finished your studies.
                <br> <br>
            </a>

                <a name="step3">
                <h3>Step 3: Hone your soft skills</h3> <br>


                In addition to your chosen data analytics course, there’s plenty you can do to enhance your learning
                experience. While the course takes care of those all-important hard skills, it’s a good idea to start
                honing your soft skills. <br> <br>

                If you need a quick refresher on the most important soft skills a data analyst should demonstrate, refer
                back to our list in section three. Armed with this list, think about the soft skills you’ve already
                perfected and identify those that might need more work. Perhaps you’re excellent at conducting research
                and solving problems as part of your current role, but haven’t had much experience of giving
                presentations. <br> <br>

                If there’s opportunity for this kind of development within your current workplace, grab it with both
                hands. Offer to run a small research project and present your findings to the team, or put your
                analytical mindset to work by offering to tackle a specific business problem. This step does require
                some creativity, especially if your current role doesn’t immediately lend itself to such opportunities.
                <br> <br>
            </a>

                <a name="step4">
                <h3>Step 4: Start networking</h3><br>

                It’s the golden rule for every industry: establishing a good network and making connections is
                absolutely essential if you want to get your foot in the door. While many of us dread the idea of
                “networking”, it doesn’t have to be as uncomfortable as it might sound. In fact, there are many
                different types of networking, ranging from a friendly message on LinkedIn to a full-on conference
                circuit. <br> <br>

                As an aspiring data analyst, it’s important to start connecting with like-minded people as early as
                possible. Not only does a good network open up potential doors in terms of career prospects; it’s also
                an excellent source of mentorship and support as you find your feet in a brand new industry. So where to
                start? Here are some excellent ways to network, both online and in person: <br> <br>

                &#149; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> — join some data analytics groups, or simply
                connect with analysts in and around your local area. <br>
                &#149; <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> — Meetup offers loads of tech and data meetups
                all over the world, ranging from the free and
                informal to the more professional events. <br>
                &#149; <b>Your student community</b> — many data analytics courses will offer you ways to get in touch
                with the wider
                student community, through Slack for example. This is a great way to lend and receive peer-to-peer
                support and potentially make offline connections, too. <br> <br>

                <h3>Step 5: Refine your portfolio and prepare for the job market</h3><br>


                The fifth and final step on the roadmap towards becoming a data analyst is to refine your portfolio and
                prepare for the job market. <br> <br>

                Your portfolio is arguably the most important asset you’ll have when it comes to applying for jobs; it
                showcases how you work and demonstrates to employers that you’ve not only mastered the right practical
                skills, but that you know how to apply them in the real world. <br> <br>

                As already mentioned, the right data analytics course will have you working on practical projects and
                guide you in the creation of a professional portfolio. Your mentor can also help you to polish up your
                portfolio and give you tips on how to present it. You can learn how to create a data analytics portfolio
                in this guide <br> <br>

                <summary>What skills are required for cloud computing ?</summary> <br>
                In general, cloud computing does not require technical IT experience. Cloud computing simply refers
                to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, databases, software, and
                analytics. Whether you have a basic understanding of computing concepts and terminology or are a
                more technical worker, you can apply the on-premises computing knowledge and skills you currently
                have to the cloud. <br>

                You might not be required to code as part of your day-to-day requirements as a data analyst. However,
                knowing how to write some basic Python or R, as well as how to write queries in SQL (Structured Query
                Language) can help you clean, analyze, and visualize data.<br>
