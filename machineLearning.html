                What is Machine Learning ? <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on
                the
                using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
                accuracy. <br> <br>
                The term was first coined by the AI pioneer Arthur Samuel, who defined ML as the “field of study that
                gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” <br> <br>

                Simply put, ML teaches machines to learn from experience, rather than being programmed for specific
                tasks.
                It is an exciting combination of statistics and computer science that enables machines to independently
                identify patterns in data. <br> <br>
                Machines are trained to make sense of large quantities of data by using various ML models and
                algorithms.
                The four basic approaches of classical ML are: <br>

                1.Supervised learning <br>
                2.Unsupervised learning <br>
                3.Semi-supervised learning <br>
                4.Reinforcement learning <br> <br>
                Machine learning engineers choose their particular machine learning algorithm based on the kind of data
                available and the problem they’re trying to solve. As machines analyze more and more data, they become
                “smarter” and can adapt to new tasks and challenges. This imitates the way humans learn
                naturally—gradually
                building skills and improving accuracy. <br> <br>

                While ML and AI have generated interest for decades, we now have the technology to fully realize its
                applications. Self-driving cars, automated chat boxes, speech recognition systems, and even video
                streaming
                recommendations all use ML processes. <br> <br>

                    Why learn Machine Learning ? <br> <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is a skill of the future. Today’s leading companies—including Facebook, Google, and
                    Uber—have made ML a central part of their operations. And with skyrocketing demand for ML
                    professionals,
                    the field faces a major skill shortage. <br> <br>

                    Understanding ML practically guarantees you a secure and lucrative career in the tech industry. With
                    an
                    extensive ML skill set, you can provide great value to your employer and boost your relevance in the
                    job
                    marketplace. <br> <br>

                    The field’s exponential growth also means that you’ll have the freedom to work in the industry of
                    your
                    choice. The World Economic Forum recently stated that “AI, Machine Learning, and automation will
                    power
                    the creation of 97 million new jobs by 2025.” As more companies embrace the utilities of ML, the
                    average
                    base salary of an ML engineer will only continue to rise in the coming years. <br> <br>

                    Machine learning is key to solving some of the biggest issues of the digital age. ML can help
                    overcome
                    critical challenges in banking and personal finance, healthcare diagnostics, image and speech
                    recognition, and fraud prevention. Solutions to these problems will help people and businesses
                    thrive,
                    and contributing to such significant progress also creates a sense of great personal satisfaction.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The unique blend of engineering, discovery, and business application also means that ML can be
                    incredibly fun! It is a vibrant field offering plenty of growth opportunities. If you are excited
                    about
                    jumping into interesting challenges and finding innovative solutions, you’ll enjoy every minute of
                    the
                    hands-on training and practice needed to learn ML. <br> <br>

                    What Does a Machine Learning Engineer Do ? <br> <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a day-to-day basis, ML engineers design, develop, test, and implement machine learning
                    algorithms.
                    Machine learning engineers use programming languages like Python, Scala, and Java to perform tasks
                    and
                    automate processes. They utilize statistical and programming skills to create and train machine
                    learning
                    models. The ultimate goal for an ML engineer is to develop self-learning applications that are both
                    accurate and efficient. <br> <br>

                    The main responsibilities of an ML engineer include: <br> <br>

                    &#9679; Study complex computer architectures, data structures, and algorithms <br>
                    &#9679; Work with data engineers to design machine learning systems<br>
                    &#9679; Manage infrastructure, data, and model pipelines<br>
                    &#9679; Ensure fidelity of datasets and data representation methods<br>
                    &#9679; Analyze large, compound datasets to identify patterns and extract insights<br>
                    &#9679; Develop algorithms based on statistical modeling procedures<br>

                <p class="display-6">Top 5 Tips for Beginners</p>
                <p>

                    If you've chosen to seriously study machine learning, then congratulations! You have a fun and
                    rewarding
                    journey ahead of you. <br>

                    Here are 5 tips that every beginner should know: <br> <br>

                    <b>1. Set concrete goals or deadlines.</b> <br>

                    Machine learning is a rich field that's expanding every year. It can be easy to go down rabbit
                    holes.
                    Set concrete goals for yourself and keep moving. <br> <br>

                    <b>2. Walk before you run.</b> <br>

                    You might be tempted to jump into some of the newest, cutting edge sub-fields in machine learning
                    such
                    as deep learning or NLP. Try to stay focused on the core concepts at the start. These advanced
                    topics
                    will be much easier to understand once you've mastered the core skills. <br> <br>

                    <b>3. Alternate between practice and theory.</b> <br>

                    Practice and theory go hand-in-hand. You won't be able to master theory without applying it, yet you
                    won't know what to do without the theory. <br> <br>

                    <b>4. Write a few algorithms from scratch.</b> <br>

                    Once you've had some practice applying algorithms from existing packages, you'll want to write a few
                    from scratch. This will take your understanding to the next level and allow you to customize them in
                    the
                    future. <br> <br>

                    <b>5. Seek different perspectives.</b>

                    The way a statistician explains an algorithm will be different from the way a computer scientist
                    explains it. Seek different explanations of the same topic. <br> <br>
